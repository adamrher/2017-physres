\section{Introduction}

%this should be included in the next paper (physres)
%When introducing a physics grid separate from the dynamics grid the question arises of what the resolution of the physics grid should be compared to the dynamics grid. For example, Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d} shows physics grids with the same, coarser and finer resolution than the GLL dynamics grid. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest resolvable wavelengths are not accurately represented. Similar arguments can be made from analyzing total kinetic energy spectra \citep{S2011LNCSE}. One may therefore argue that only believable scales should be passed to the physical parameterizations \citep{LH1997MWR}, i.e. a coarser resolution physics grid. This concept was investigated in a spectral transform model by \cite{W1999T}. On the other hand, computing physics tendencies on a higher-resolution grid compared to the dynamical core may provide a better sampling of the atmospheric state, somewhat similar to the super-parameterization \citep{G2001JAS,GRL:GRL14999,SA2007ASL} and sub-columns{\footnote{\citet{gmdd-8-5041-2015} in the context of CAM}} \citep{subcolumn,JGRD:JGRD10481} concepts. This approach was taken by \cite{M2009T} in the context of vertical refinement. \cite{W2014PTRSL} found improved forecast scores by increasing the grid-point space resolution compared to the resolution in wave-number space for the spectral transform model at ECMWF. 

%Alternatively, one could combine the two ideas and compute the state of the atmosphere on a coarser resolution grid and then use sub-columns or super-parameterization. One thereby passes believable scales to the sub-grid scale model and thereby assumes that a statistical sampling, in the case of sub-columns, or a simplified cloud-resolving model, in the case of super-parameterization, provides a more accurate sub-grid-scale tendency than sampling the Galerkin basis functions over the sub-grid-scale. [Discuss \cite{W2014PTRSL}: spectral truncation and physics (physical) grid (see page 10; conclusions)]




%Separating physics and dynamics grids has been investigated in the context of spectral transform models by \citet{TELA:TELA0009}, in which the separation was performed by truncation in wavenumber space. Parts of the physical parameterizations (microphysics) were separated in \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} and vertical grid separation was investigated in \citet{TELA:TELA394}. In this study we run all of the parameterization on the physgrid.


%In the context of spectral transform model \citet{TELA:TELA0009} held the physics forcing scale fixed while refining the horizontal resolution of the dynamical core. In the context of microphysics \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} did a scale separation and \citet{TELA:TELA394} separated the vertical grids. While \citet{LH1997MWR} and \citet{TELA:TELA0009} separated scales truncation of the the wave transform, we here separate scales through integrating basis functions over control volumes and , contrary to \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711}, all of the physical parameterization computations are performed on the physgrid. We focus on horizontal separation of scales here.
