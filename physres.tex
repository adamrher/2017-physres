%When introducing a physics grid separate from the dynamics grid the question arises of what the resolution of the physics grid should be compared to the dynamics grid. For example, Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d} shows physics grids with the same, coarser and finer resolution than the GLL dynamics grid. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest resolvable wavelengths are not accurately represented. Similar arguments can be made from analyzing total kinetic energy spectra \citep{S2011LNCSE}. One may therefore argue that only believable scales should be passed to the physical parameterizations \citep{LH1997MWR}, i.e. a coarser resolution physics grid. This concept was investigated in a spectral transform model by \cite{W1999T}. On the other hand, computing physics tendencies on a higher-resolution grid compared to the dynamical core may provide a better sampling of the atmospheric state, somewhat similar to the super-parameterization \citep{G2001JAS,GRL:GRL14999,SA2007ASL} and sub-columns{\footnote{\citet{gmdd-8-5041-2015} in the context of CAM}} \citep{subcolumn,JGRD:JGRD10481} concepts. This approach was taken by \cite{M2009T} in the context of vertical refinement. \cite{W2014PTRSL} found improved forecast scores by increasing the grid-point space resolution compared to the resolution in wave-number space for the spectral transform model at ECMWF. 

%Alternatively, one could combine the two ideas and compute the state of the atmosphere on a coarser resolution grid and then use sub-columns or super-parameterization. One thereby passes believable scales to the sub-grid scale model and thereby assumes that a statistical sampling, in the case of sub-columns, or a simplified cloud-resolving model, in the case of super-parameterization, provides a more accurate sub-grid-scale tendency than sampling the Galerkin basis functions over the sub-grid-scale. [Discuss \cite{W2014PTRSL}: spectral truncation and physics (physical) grid (see page 10; conclusions)]

%Separating physics and dynamics grids has been investigated in the context of spectral transform models by \citet{TELA:TELA0009}, in which the separation was performed by truncation in wavenumber space. Parts of the physical parameterizations (microphysics) were separated in \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} and vertical grid separation was investigated in \citet{TELA:TELA394}. In this study we run all of the parameterization on the physgrid.

%In the context of spectral transform model \citet{TELA:TELA0009} held the physics forcing scale fixed while refining the horizontal resolution of the dynamical core. In the context of microphysics \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} did a scale separation and \citet{TELA:TELA394} separated the vertical grids. While \citet{LH1997MWR} and \citet{TELA:TELA0009} separated scales truncation of the the wave transform, we here separate scales through integrating basis functions over control volumes and , contrary to \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711}, all of the physical parameterization computations are performed on the physgrid. We focus on horizontal separation of scales here.

%In order to understand the results of \cite{W1999T}, it is necessary to understand the impact of grid resolution on the model solution.  While no complete theory for the resolution sensitivty of global atmopsheric models exists, there are no shortage of convergence studies (see \cite{HR2017JCLIM} and references therein). These studies are performed at resolutions typical of present day General Circulation Models (GCMs), and often use idealized aqua-planet boundary conditions. Aqua-planet configurations are useful for convergence studies since they are devoid of boundary conditions that would otherwise vary with resolution in more realistic configurations (e.g. topography), while still maintaing some resemblance of Earth's climate. A robust result from these convergence studies is that the strength of the Hadley Cell tends to increase with resolution \citep{HR2017JCLIM}, although there are exceptions (see XXXX).

\section{Introduction}

Global atmospheric models fundamentally consist of two components. The dynamical core ({\em{dynamics}}), which advances the adiabatic equations of motion, and the physical parameterizations ({\em{physics}}), which compute the effects of diabatic and subgrid-scale processes (e.g., radiative transfer and moist convection) on the resolved scales. More out of convenience than anything else, the physics are evaluated on the dynamics grid, i.e., the physics grid and dynamics grid coincide. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest simulated wavelengths are not accurately represented by the dynamical core. Similar arguments can be made thourgh an analysis of the kinetic energy spectra in model simulations \citep{S2011LNCSE}. The grid-scale is therefore under-resolved, leading some to speculate whether the physics should be evaluated on a grid that is more reflective of the scales actually resolved by the dynamical core \citep{LH1997MWR,W2007JMSJ,S2011LNCSE}.

Experimentation with different physics grid resolutions have so far been limited to models employing the spectral transform method \citep{LH1997MWR,W1999T,W2014PTRSL}. \cite{LH1997MWR} argue that passing under-resolved states to the physics may be problematic in spectral transform models, since the physics are evaluated on a transform grid in grid point space, which contains more degrees of freedom than the spectral representation to prevent aliasing of quadratic quantaties. \cite{W2014PTRSL} have experimented with different transform grid resolutions, and concluded that increasing the resolution in grid-point space relative to the spectral truncation improves forecast skill. \cite{W2014PTRSL} speculates that the spectral truncation may be thought of as an effective filter, mitigtaing any undesireable artifacts arising from passing under-resolved states to the physics, refuting the concerns of \cite{LH1997MWR}. After the physics forcing is transformed into wave-space, it is straightforward to truncate the physics at any desired wavenumber. 

\cite{W1999T} conducted a convergence study using a global spectral transform model, in which the truncation wavenumber of the physics forcing was held fixed, while increasing the resolution of the dynamical core. When the physics and dynamics resolution were increased in tandem, the strength of the Hadley Cell increased montonically with resolution. But when the truncation wavenumber of physics forcing was held fixed, the Hadley Cell showed very little sensitivity to dynamical core resolution, resembling the solution for which the dynamics and physics truncation wavenumber are the same. The results of \cite{W1999T} suggest that the dynamical core resolution is aliased to the resolution of the physics forcing. 

It is well known that the equations of motion have implicit scale-dependencies at hydrostatic scales \citep{O1981JAS}. Perhaps the most dramatic scale depedency occurs under gravitational instability, in which the vertical velocity scales as the inverse of the horizontal scale of the Archimedean buoyancy \citep{JR2016QJRMS,HR2017JCLIM,HR2018JAMES}. \cite{HR2018JAMES} have shown that an increase in horizontal resolution does lead to a reduction in the horizontal scale of the temperature tendencies from the physics, which dictates the Archimedean buoyancy. As a result, larger magnitude vertical motion characterizes the model solution, which \cite{HR2017JCLIM} hypothesizes steers the model towards a new equilibrium.

In contrast to spectral-transform methods, high-order element-based Galerkin methods are prone to grid-imprinting \citep{HL2018MWR}, and need be considered when contemplating a particular physics grid. High-order Galerkin methods are becoming increasingly popular in climate and weather applications due to their high-order accuracy (for smooth problems), high-parallel efficiency, high-processor efficiency and geometric flexibility facilitating mesh-refinenment applications. In this study, we develop and implement a coarser physics grid into the Community Atmopshere Model (CAM), with spectral-element dynamics, a high-order Galerkin method, and coupled to the Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Multi-tracer transport scheme \citep[CAM-SE-CSLAM; ][]{LTOUNGK2017MWR}. The grid spacing on the coarse physics grid is 1.5 times larger than the tracer transport and dynamics grids. We test the hypothesis, that the coarser physics grid is effective at reducing spurious noise, particularly over regions of rough topography, in CAM-SE-CSLAM. 

Any advantages of using a coarser resolution physics grid need be weighed against any potential reduction in the model's effective resolution, which may occur through aliasing of the solution to the coarser physics grid \citep{W1999T}. Section 2 describes the implementation of the coarse physics grid into CAM-SE-CSLAM. Section 3 provides the results of a hierarchy of model configurations to test our hypothesis, and an analysis of the impact of the coarser physics grid on the resolved scales of motion. Section 4 provides a discussion of the results and conclusions.

\section{Results}

A plethora of grids are developed for CAM-SE-CSLAM (Table \ref{table:grids}), and used to understand the sensitivity to physics grid resolution, across a wide range of spectral-element grid resolutions. The physics time-step, $\Delta t_{phys}$, used for each grid is scaled by the dynamics time-step to prevent time truncation errors at higher resolutions \citep{HR2018JAMES}. A hierarchy of idealized model configurations are presented (available from CESM2.0; \url{https://doi.org/10.5065/D67H1H0V}) to illuminate the differences between $pg2$ and $pg3$.

\subsection{Held-Suarez with Topography}

Flow over rough topography may facilitate significant grid imprinting using the spectral element method \citep{gmdd-8-4623-2015,HL2018MWR}. A Held-Suarez configuration, modified with real world topography is used to identify grid imprinting over mountainous terrain. Figure \ref{fig:fhs-contours} (middle panel) shows the climatological mean vertical pressure velocity, $\omega$, over the Andes and Himalayan region and at two different levels in the mid-troposphere, using the $ne30pg3$ grid. All Held-Suarez simulations are ran for two-years. The figure is displayed as a raster plot on the native physics grid, so that indidual extrema, which characterize the flow over the Andes between about $10^\circ-20^\circ$ S, may be identified as spurious. Similarly, at the foot of the Himalayas, their are spurious oscillatory bands of upward and downward motion aligned with the element boundaries \citep[see also ][]{HL2018MWR}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=30pc,angle=0]{figs/fhstopo_ne30pg2-v-ne30pg3-v-10Xnudiv.pdf}\\
\end{center}
\caption{Mean $\omega$ at two model levels in the middle troposphere, in a Held-Suarez configuration outfitted with real world topography. (Left) $ne30pg2$ (Middle) $ne30pg3$ and (Right) $ne30pg3$ with the divergence damping coefficient increased by an order of magnitude. The $\omega$ fields are computed a two-year simulation. The data are presented on a raster plot in order to identify individual grid cells}
\label{fig:fhs-contours}
\end{figure}

As discussed in \cite{HL2018MWR}, grid imprinting over mountainous regions tends to occur in regions of weak stability, and the extrema often  manifest as full tropsphere upward/downward couplets. Thus, grid imprinting over mountains may be alleviated through increasing the divergence damping in the model. Figure \ref{fig:fhs-contours} (right panel) repeats the $ne30pg3$ simulation, but increasing the divergence damping coefficient by an order of magnitude. The spurious noise over the Andes and the Himalayas are damped, as grid point extrema tends to be diffused into neighboring grid cells. The wavenumber-power spectrum of the kinetic energy arising from divergent modes is provided in Figure \ref{fig:fhs-div}, confirming that divergent modes are significantly damped at higher wavenumbers relative to the default $ne30pg3$ simulation. Requiring the divergence damping coefficient to be an order of magnitude larger than is required for numerical stability is not ideal from a model development perspective. The hyper-viscosity coefficients are one of the only free-parameters in the dynamical core to tune the kinetic energy spectrum to observations \citep{SPKS2014JAS,LetAl2018JAMES}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=25pc,angle=0]{figs/fhstopo_Divergence_ne30pg2-v-ne30pg3-v-10Xnudiv.pdf}\\

\label{fig:fhs-div}
\end{figure}

The $\omega$ field in a $ne30pg2$ simulation is provided in Figure \ref{fig:fhs-contours} (left panel). Grid cell extrema over the Andes is less prevalent than in the $ne30pg3$ simulation, as seen by the reduction in large magnitude $\omega$ (e.g., red grid cells). The spurious oscillations at the foot of the Himalayas appears to have been entirely eliminated. This improvement in grid imprinting is due to the consistent sampling of nodal types in the $pg2$ configuration discussed in Section \ref{}. The divergent modes are slightly damped relative to the $ne30pg3$ simulations, somewhat sytematically at high wavenumbers, and much less than the simulation using the larger divergence damping coefficient (Figure \ref{fig:fhs-div}).  

\subsection{Aqua-planets}

The results of the previous section are consistent with our hypothesis, that spurious noise is effectively reduced, and visibly eliminated using a $pg2$ grid. We now turn to the question of whether the coarser resolution physics grid has an impact on the resolved scales of motion. This analysis will make use of an aqua-planet configuration \citep{NH2000ASL,MWO2016JAMES}; an ocean covered planet in perpetual equinox, and fixed, zonally-symmetric sea surface temperatures idealized after present day Earth. The aqua-planets are run for one simulated year, using CAM, version 6 physics (CAM6; $QPC6$ compset in CESM2.0).

\cite{HR2017JCLIM} has shown that through assuming the horizontal scale of the Archimedean buoyancy is linearly proportional to the grid spacing, the magnitude of the vertical motion in aqua-planet runs did not scale like the inverse of the grid-spacing across a set of grid resolutions. However, the results of \cite{HR2018JAMES} indicate that the scaling may be recovered through a more judicous choice of $\Delta t_{phys}$ (Table \ref{table:grids}). To test this idea, three aqua-planet simulations are carried out using the $ne30pg3$, $ne60pg3$ and $ne120pg3$ grids. 

Figure \ref{fig:pg3panel}a shows the wavenumber-power spectrum of the moist physics temperature tendencies (referred to as {\em{forcing}} throughout this study) in the upper troposphere, where statiform heating is common due to detrainment by the deep-convection scheme \citep{ZM1995AO}. There is a clear reduction in forcing scale with resolution, which is consistent with the increased magnitude of $\omega$ with resolution, expressed by the probability density distribution (PDF) of upward $\omega$, everywhere in the model (Figure \ref{fig:pg3panel}b). The PDFs may be scaled to the $ne120pg3$ grid using the scaling of \cite{PG2006JAS}, 
\begin{equation}
P(\omega_{s}) = \alpha \times P(\omega/\alpha),\label{eq:pdf}
\end{equation}
where $P(\omega_{s})$ is the PDF of the scaled $\omega$, $\omega_{s}$, and $\alpha$ is the ratio of the vertical velocity scale to the vertical velocity scale of the target grid resolution, set to $\alpha = \Delta x_{target}/\Delta x$, after \citep{HR2018JAMES}, where $\Delta x$ is the grid spacing and $\Delta x_{target}$ is the grid spacing of the target resolution. The scaled PDFs do not line up perfectly on top one another (Figure \ref{fig:pg3panel}c), but the scaling explains the change in magnitude of $\omega$ with resolution to first order. This result is consistent with the notion that the characteristic forcing scales in the simulations are linearly proportional to the grid spacing.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=30pc,angle=0]{figs/pg3panel.png}\\
\end{center}
\caption{(a) Wavenumber-power spectrum of the temperature tendencies from the moist physics, near the 369 hPa level, (b) probability density distribution and (c) the scaled probability density distribution of upward $\omega$ everywhere in the model, from three year long aqua-planet simulations at different grid resolutions.}
\label{fig:pg3panel}
\end{figure}

When the physics and dynamics grids are of a different resolution, it is not clear which grid determines the forcing scale. If the characteristic forcing scale is determined by the physics grid spacing, $\Delta x_{phys}$, than the $ne30pg2$ solution should more closely resemble the $ne20pg3$ solution, in which both the physics and dynamics grids are equal to the physics grid of $ne30pg2$. Likewise, if the dynamics grid spacing, $\Delta x_{dyn}$, governs the forcing scale than the $ne30pg2$ solution would more closely resemble the $ne30pg3$ solution. Figure \ref{fig:pg2panel}a is the PDF of upward $\omega$ for simluations using the $ne20pg3$, $ne30pg2$ and $ne30pg3$ grids. It is clear that the $ne30pg2$ solution more closely resembles the $ne30pg3$ solution. Scaling the $ne20pg3$ solution to $ne30pg3$ using eqn. \ref{eq:pdf} does a fair job of predicting the $ne30pg3$ magnitudes (Figure \ref{fig:pg2panel}b), again consistent with a linear relation between forcing scale and grid spacing. Scaling the $ne30pg2$ PDF to the $ne30pg3$ grid using $\Delta x_{phys}$ overestimates the magnitude of $\omega$ in the $ne30pg3$ solution, suggesting the characteristic forcing scale can not be proportional to $\Delta x_{phys}$. 

The dynamical core requires explicit numerical damping to increase with $\Delta x_{dyn}$ for numerical stability, the exact relation provided in the appendix of \cite{LetAl2018JAMES}. The hyper-viscosity coefficients are therefore smaller (and equal) in the $ne30pg2$ and $ne30pg3$ simulations, relative to the $ne20pg3$ simulation. Figure \ref{fig:pg2panel}a (green line) shows the PDF of upward $\omega$ for a $ne30pg2$ simulation, in which the hyper-viscosity coefficients are increased to $ne20pg3$ values (referred to as $ne30pg2-hivisc$). The solution now more closely resembles the $ne20pg3$ solution, indicating that an increase in explicit damping results in an increase in characteristic forcing scale. Through scaling the $ne30pg2-hivisc$ solutions to the $ne30pg3$ grid using $\Delta x_{phys}$, the scaled solution lie much closer to the $ne30pg3$ solution, compared wth scaling the default $ne30pg2$ solution using $\Delta x_{phys}$. When using a slightly lower resolution physics grid, $\Delta x_{phys}/\Delta x_{dyn} = 1.5$, it seems the forcing scale is determined by $\Delta x_{dyn}$, primarily a result of $\Delta x_{dyn}$ dependent hyper-viscous damping.

\end{figure}

The vertical velocity scale is determined by the characteristic forcing scale on the dynamical core grid. Mapping the physics forcing to the dynamics grid using a high-order reconstruction may introduce some fine scale features that the physics grid is unable to support, potentially increasing the vertical velocity scale. A $ne30pg2$ simulation using low-order reconstruction (bilinear interpolation from $pg2$ to $GLL$, and piecewise-constant mapping between $pg2$ and $CSLAM$ grids; referred to as $ne30pg2-loworder$) is carried out. The wavenumber-power spectrum of the physics forcing in the upper-troposphere on the physics grid (Figure \ref{fig:loworder}a), and after the forcing is mapped to the dynamics grid (Figure \ref{fig:loworder}b) is provided for the $ne30pg2-loworder$, $ne30pg2$ and $ne30pg3$ simulations. 

On the physics grid, power at high wavenumbers is reduced in $ne30pg2-loworder$ compared with the default $ne30pg2$ solution, and both have less power than the $ne30pg3$ solution at most wavenumbers. On the dynamics grid, $ne30pg2-loworder$ is the only solution with a clear reduction in power compared with $ne30pg3$ \textemdash the power spectrum of the $ne30pg2$ simulation is indistinguishable from the $ne30pg3$ solution at high wavenumbers (but note the damped oscillations in the $10-20$ wavenumber window in $ne30pg2$). The PDFs of upward $\omega$ indicate the magnitude of the $ne30pg2$ solution lies intermediate to the two other simulations, but the magnitudes are closer to the $ne30pg3$ solution in the higher probability regions (greater than -2 hPa/day). High-order mapping is therefore an effective means to mitigate any loss in effective resolution arising from the use of a coarser physics grid.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  IN-TEXT LISTS

% Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
