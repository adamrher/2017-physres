%When introducing a physics grid separate from the dynamics grid the question arises of what the resolution of the physics grid should be compared to the dynamics grid. For example, Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d} shows physics grids with the same, coarser and finer resolution than the GLL dynamics grid. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest resolvable wavelengths are not accurately represented. Similar arguments can be made from analyzing total kinetic energy spectra \citep{S2011LNCSE}. One may therefore argue that only believable scales should be passed to the physical parameterizations \citep{LH1997MWR}, i.e. a coarser resolution physics grid. This concept was investigated in a spectral transform model by \cite{W1999T}. On the other hand, computing physics tendencies on a higher-resolution grid compared to the dynamical core may provide a better sampling of the atmospheric state, somewhat similar to the super-parameterization \citep{G2001JAS,GRL:GRL14999,SA2007ASL} and sub-columns{\footnote{\citet{gmdd-8-5041-2015} in the context of CAM}} \citep{subcolumn,JGRD:JGRD10481} concepts. This approach was taken by \cite{M2009T} in the context of vertical refinement. \cite{W2014PTRSL} found improved forecast scores by increasing the grid-point space resolution compared to the resolution in wave-number space for the spectral transform model at ECMWF. 

%Alternatively, one could combine the two ideas and compute the state of the atmosphere on a coarser resolution grid and then use sub-columns or super-parameterization. One thereby passes believable scales to the sub-grid scale model and thereby assumes that a statistical sampling, in the case of sub-columns, or a simplified cloud-resolving model, in the case of super-parameterization, provides a more accurate sub-grid-scale tendency than sampling the Galerkin basis functions over the sub-grid-scale. [Discuss \cite{W2014PTRSL}: spectral truncation and physics (physical) grid (see page 10; conclusions)]

%Separating physics and dynamics grids has been investigated in the context of spectral transform models by \citet{TELA:TELA0009}, in which the separation was performed by truncation in wavenumber space. Parts of the physical parameterizations (microphysics) were separated in \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} and vertical grid separation was investigated in \citet{TELA:TELA394}. In this study we run all of the parameterization on the physgrid.

%In the context of spectral transform model \citet{TELA:TELA0009} held the physics forcing scale fixed while refining the horizontal resolution of the dynamical core. In the context of microphysics \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} did a scale separation and \citet{TELA:TELA394} separated the vertical grids. While \citet{LH1997MWR} and \citet{TELA:TELA0009} separated scales truncation of the the wave transform, we here separate scales through integrating basis functions over control volumes and , contrary to \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711}, all of the physical parameterization computations are performed on the physgrid. We focus on horizontal separation of scales here.

\section{Introduction}

Global atmospheric models fundamentally consist of two components. The dynamical core, which advances the equations of motion on a discrete grid, and the physical parameterizations, which compute the effect of diabatic and subgrid-scale processes (e.g., radiative transfer and moist convection) on the resolved scales. Conventionally, the physical paramterizations are evaluated on the dynamical core grid. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest resolvable wavelengths are not accurately represented by the dynamical core. Similar arguments can be made from analyzing total kinetic energy spectra \citep{S2011LNCSE}. One may therefore argue that only believable scales should be passed to the physical parameterizations \citep{LH1997MWR}, i.e. the physical parameterizations should be evaluated on a coarser grid. This concept was first investigated in a spectral transform model by \cite{W1999T}. 

In order to understand the results of \cite{W1999T}, it is necessary to understand the impact of grid resolution on the solution.  While no complete theory for the resolution sensitivty of global atmopsheric models exists, their are no shortage of convergence studies. These studies are often performed at resolutions typical of present day General Circulation Models (GCMs), and often use idealized aqua-planet boundary conditions. Aqua-planet configurations are useful for convergence studies since they are devoid of boundary conditions that would otherwise vary with resolution in more realistic configurations (e.g. topography), while still maintaing some resemblance of Earth's climate. A robust result from these convergence studies is that the strength of the Hadley Cell tends to increase with resolution (see \cite{HR2017JCLIM} and references therein), with some exceptions (see XXXX).

Likewise, \cite{W1999T} found the strength of Hadley Cell increased with resolution in their convergence study. But \cite{W1999T} then performed an additional test, one in which the dynamical core resolution was increased, but the physical paramterizations were evaluated from a truncated state, and that truncation wavenumber was held fixed across resolutions. The resulting Hadley Cell showed very little sensitivity to dynamical core resolution, resembling the solution for which the resolution of the dynamical core was equal to the resolution of the truncated physics forcing. \cite{W2007JMSJ} reflects on this study years later, suggesting that the scales of motion resolved by the dynamical core appeared to be aliased to the truncation scale of the physics forcing. This finding lead \cite{W2007JMSJ} to question the advantage of using a coarser physics grid to filter out the under-resolved scales, as advocated by \citep{LH1997MWR}. 

It is well known that the equations of motion have implicit scale-dependencies at hydrostatic scales \citep{O1981JAS}. Perhaps the most dramatic scale depedency occurs under gravitational instability, as the vertical velocity scale is proportional to the horizontal scale of the buoyancy. \cite{HR2017JCLIM} hypothesize that an increase in resolution leads to a proportional reduction in the horizontal scale of the physics forcing, resulting in larger magnitude vertical motion in the ascending branch of the Hadley Cell, and ultimately equilibrating with a stronger overturning circulation. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of \cite{W1999T}, since if the truncation scale of the physics forcing is held fixed, the vertical motion will be aliased to horizontal scale of the coarser physics forcing, and the vertical velocity scale will be unchanged.
