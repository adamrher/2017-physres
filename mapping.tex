The mapping algorithm is applied to each element $\Omega$ (with spherical area $\Delta \Omega$) so without loss of generality consider one element. Let $\Delta A^{(pg)}_k$ and $\Delta A^{(cslam)}_\ell$ be the spherical area of the physics grid grid cell $A^{(pg)}_k$ and CSLAM control volume $A^{(cslam)}_\ell$, respectively. The physics grid cells and CSLAM cells respectively span the element without gaps or overlaps
\begin{eqnarray}
\cup_{k=1}^{pg^2}A^{(pg)}_k=\Omega \text{ and } A^{(pg)}_k \cap A^{(pg)}_\ell = \emptyset \quad \forall k\ne \ell,\\
\cup_{k=1}^{nc^2}A^{(cslam)}_k=\Omega \text{ and } A^{(cslam)}_k \cap A^{(cslam)}_\ell = \emptyset \quad \forall k\ne \ell.
\end{eqnarray}
The overlap areas between the $k$-th physics grid cell and CSLAM cells is denoted
\begin{equation}
A_{k\ell}=A^{(pg)}_k \cap A^{(cslam)}_\ell,
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
A^{(pg)}_k=\cup_{l=1}^{nc^2}A_{k\ell}.
\end{equation}
The tendencies from the parameterizations are computed on the physics grid. The tracer tendency in physics grid cell $k$ is denoted $f_k^{(pg)}$. The problem is how to map $f_k^{(pg)}$ to the CSLAM control volumes $f^{(cslam)}$ satisfying the following constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf{Local mass-conservation}}
\begin{equation}
f_k^{(pg)}\Delta p^{(pg)}_k=\cup_{\ell=1}^{nc^2}\Delta A_{k\ell}\Delta p^{(cslam)}_\ell f^{(cslam)}_\ell,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta p^{(pg)}_k$ is the pressure level thickness in physics grid cell $k$ and similarly for $\Delta p^{(cslam)}$.
\item {\bf{Shape-preservation in mixing ratio}}: The forcing on the CSLAM grid should not produce a value smaller than the new physics grid mixing ratio, $m^{(pg)}_k+\Delta tf_k^{(pg)}$ or a value smaller than the existing CSLAM mixing ratios over the overlap areas $m^{(cslam)}_{k\ell}$
\begin{equation}
m_k^{(min)}=\min \left( m^{(pg)}_k+\Delta t f_k^{(pg)},\left\{ m^{(cslam)}_{k\ell} |\ell=1,nc^2\right\} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the physics time-step. Similarly for maxima
\begin{equation}
m_k^{(max)}=\max \left( m^{(pg)}_k+\Delta t f_k^{(pg)},\left\{ m^{(cslam)}_{k\ell} |\ell=1,nc^2\right\} \right),
\end{equation}
\item {\bf{Linear correlation preservation}}: The physics forcing must not disrupt linear tracer correlation between species on the CSLAM grid \citep[see, e.g., ][]{LT2011QJR}.
\item {\bf{Consistency}}: A constant mixing ratio tendency, $cnst$, on the physics grid, $f_k^{(pg)}=cnst$ $\forall k$, must result in the same (constant) forcing on the CSLAM grid, $f_\ell^{(cslam)}=f_k^{(pg)}=cnst$ $\forall \ell$.
\end{enumerate}
To motivate the algorithm that will simultaneously satisfy 1-4 it is informative to discuss how `standard' mapping algorithms will violate one or more of the constraints.
\begin{itemize}
\item Conservative remapping: 
\item Interpolation:
\end{itemize}
