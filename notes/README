-mapping dp and tracers with PCoM from fvm to phys and temperature with SE basis function integration from
 gll to phys leads to element noise in PRECC
-mapping dp and tracers with PPM from fvm to phys and temperature with SE basis function integration from
 gll to phys does not lead to element noise => consistency between T,dp and water tracers seems important
-mapping phys2fvm with PPM or PCoM does not seem to affect element noise
